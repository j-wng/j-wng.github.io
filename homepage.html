  In a press release accompanying their annual update to their military arms trade registries database, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported a number of their major statistical findings. In bold-texted font, the headline for this year’s report reads “Global arms trade: USA increases dominance, arms flows to the Middle East surge”, a statement that would seem to make sense to anyone intuitively who is even remotely aware of current events. The press release goes on to report a 7.8% increase in the volume of international arms transfers for the years 2014-2018 compared to 2009-2013 (a 23% increase when compared to 2004-2008). Last year, the United States, Russia, France, Germany, and China claimed the top 5 positions in major arms exporters, whereas countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, Qatar, and Iraq all saw marked increases in the number of imports. Venezuela, on the other hand, decreased its arms important by a sharp 83% over the course of the last four years.

Since the release of the data, similarly brief articles on the “ups-and-downs” of national weapons flows have been popping up on the Internet as news blurbs and short articles, oftentimes published on blogs and small news sites. Asides for a listicle from the USA Today on the top 20 arms producers in the world, the US has almost zero media presence in the Google News section when “SIPRI” is used as a search term. The news outlets that do pop up instead are surprisingly diverse: the German website Deutsche Welle, the South China Morning Post, the English-language Indian news site The Print, and the Turkish version of Sputnik, just to name a few. For someone used to seeing news dominated by CNN, the New York Times, POLITICO, and Fox News, it feels a bit strange to be wandering onto a part of the internet where their silence on an issue like global trends in armament is so palpably felt.

On the website, the institute suggests a few possible uses for its data, which range from studying how weapons trade relationships between nations have changed over time, where countries in conflict get their weapons, and where potentially volatile buildups of weapons are occuring. They say this despite the fact that their data relies only on publicly disclosed records of weapons transfers, which are, safe to say, generally underestimates of the entire arms trade ecosystem as a whole given the penchants of militaries to working in secrecy. From the get go, it is clear with this project that “data” is not “fact”, but is a mediated representation of a much greater totality.
