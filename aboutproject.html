<h1>About the Project</h1>
<h2>Possible questions to address:</h2>

<u1>
  <li>Whether public disclosures of weapons exchange can reflect the actual material conditions of war</li>
  <li>Tracking technological change in warfare</li>
  <li>Creating a sense of the human toll brought around by weapon commodity flow</li>
  <li>Probably in a gallery, try to tell a story of how these weapons have been utilized historically and their legacy (i.e. as unexploded ordnances in Laos or Vietnam).</li>
